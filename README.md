# Anomalyze

## Overview

**Anomalyze** is a deep learning framework for **automated nuchal translucency (NT) measurement** from fetal ultrasound scans acquired during the **11‚Äì14 week gestational window**. NT thickness is a clinically validated biomarker for early detection of **chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Trisomy 21), congenital heart defects, and other structural anomalies**.

Manual NT measurement is highly operator-dependent and subject to inter-observer variability. **EchoWomb standardizes this process through a fully automated pipeline**, integrating **segmentation, classification, and generative augmentation models** to achieve consistent, precise, and real-time NT assessment.

This repository provides the **complete workflow**: from image preprocessing and model training to evaluation, optimization, and deployment for clinical integration.



## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Segmentation**:

  * U-Net, ResU-Net, and Attention U-Net architectures for pixel-accurate delineation of NT boundaries.
* **Classification**:

  * EfficientNet and Vision Transformers for NT thickness-based risk stratification.
* **Preprocessing Pipeline**:

  * CLAHE, Gaussian/wavelet denoising, ROI extraction, and artifact suppression to normalize ultrasound inputs.
* **Generative Augmentation**:

  * GAN-based synthetic image generation to mitigate dataset scarcity and enhance model robustness.
* **Optimization & Evaluation**:

  * Hybrid loss functions (Dice + BCE), K-fold cross-validation, AUROC, IoU, and Dice Score.
* **Deployment**:

  * Model pruning, quantization, and compression for edge-device inference and real-time ultrasound integration.



## üìä Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

* **Dataset**: First-trimester fetal ultrasound scans (11‚Äì14 weeks).
* **Normalization**: Intensity standardization across heterogeneous ultrasound devices.
* **Enhancement**: Adaptive histogram equalization, Gaussian/wavelet denoising.
* **ROI Extraction**: Bounding-box localization of NT region and patch-based segmentation for fine detail.

### 2. Model Development

* **Segmentation Networks**:

  * U-Net baseline for medical image segmentation.
  * ResU-Net with residual skip connections for deeper feature learning.
  * Attention U-Net for contextual focus on NT boundaries.
* **Classification Networks**:

  * EfficientNet (lightweight, parameter-efficient backbone).
  * Vision Transformers (ViTs) for global contextual reasoning on NT thickness.
* **Generative Models**:

  * GANs trained on ultrasound distributions to augment rare NT cases.
* **Attention Mechanisms**:

  * Transformer-based feature refinement for improved classification sensitivity.

### 3. Training & Evaluation
